 hardlim Positive hard limit transfer function.
 	
  Transfer functions convert a neural network layer's net input into
  its net output.
 	
  A = hardlim(N) takes an SxQ matrix of S N-element net input column
  vectors and returns an SxQ matrix A of output vectors with a 1 in
  each position where the corresponding element of N was 0 or greater,
  and 0 elsewhere.
 
  hardlim('da_dn',N,A) returns the derivative of layer outputs A with
  respect to net inputs N. derivatives for this function are always zero.
 
  Here a layer output is calculate from a single net input vector:
 
    n = [0; 1; -0.5; 0.5];
    a = hardlim(n);
 
  Here is a plot of this transfer function:
 
    n = -5:0.01:5;
    plot(n,hardlim(n))
    set(gca,'dataaspectratio',[1 1 1],'xgrid','on','ygrid','on')
 
  Here this transfer function is assigned to the ith layer of a network:
 
    net.layers{i}.transferFcn = 'hardlim';
